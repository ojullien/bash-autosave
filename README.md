## Installation

Require a Debian/Ubuntu version of linux and a Bash version ~4.4.

1. [Download a release](https://github.com/ojullien/Shell/releases) or clone this repository.
2. Use [scripts/installShell.sh](https://github.com/ojullien/Shell/tree/master/scripts) to automatically install the project in the /opt/ folder.
3. If needed, add `PATH="$PATH:/opt/oju/Shell/bin"` to the .profile files.
4. For each apps in [app folder](https://github.com/ojullien/Shell/tree/master/src/app) check out and edit the configuration file named `config.sh`.
5. Run the app you want. In [Shell/bin](https://github.com/ojullien/Shell/tree/master/src/bin) folder run `./<app_name>.sh` or `bash <app_name>.sh`.

All the main app scripts can take, at least, the following options:

- `-n | --no-display` Display mode. Contents are not displayed.
- `-l | --active-log` Log mode. Contents are logged.
- `-w | --wait` Wait user. Wait for user input between actions.
- `-h | --help` Show the help..
- `-v | --version` Show the version.

## Documentation

I wrote and I use these scripts for my own projects. And, unfortunately, I do not provide exhaustive documentation. Please read the code and the comments ;)

## Test

I wrote few lines of 'unit test' code for the core framework (sys). No more, sorry.

## Contributing

Thanks you for taking the time to contribute. Please fork the repository and make changes as you'd like.

As I use these scripts for my own projects, it contains only the features I need. But If you have any ideas, just open an [issue](https://github.com/ojullien/Shell/issues/new) and tell me what you think. Pull requests are also warmly welcome.

If you encounter any **bugs**, please open an [issue](https://github.com/ojullien/Shell/issues/new).

Be sure to include a title and clear description,as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
